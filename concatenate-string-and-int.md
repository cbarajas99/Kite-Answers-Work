# How to print a string and an integer in Python
Printing a string and an integer prints them on the same line.

## Use `,` and [`print()`](kite-sym:builtins.print) to print a string and and an integer {#use-comma}
Call [`print(value)`](kite-sym:builtins.print) with `value` as a string followed by a comma and an integer to print them on the same line.
```python
a_string = "string"
an_integer = 1

print(a_string, an_integer)
```
