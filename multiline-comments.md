# How to create a multiline comment in python
Creating a multiline comment allows multiple lines of comments without having to put `#` at the start of every line.

## Use triple quotations to create a multiline comment {#use-triple-quotations}
Enclose a comment with single triple quotes `'''` to create a comment spanning multiple lines.

```python
'''
This is a
multiline comment
'''
```
Alternatively, use double triple quotes `"""`to create a multiline comment.

```python
"""
This is a
multiline comment
"""
```
