# How to get the maximum of two numbers in Python
The maximum of two numbers is the greater of the two. For example, the maximum of `1` and `2` is `2`.

## Use [`max()`](kite-sym:builtins.max) to get the maximum of two numbers {#use-max}
Call [`max(*args)`](kite-sym:builtins.max) with two numbers as `*args` to return the maximum of the two.

```python
# Get maximum of `1` and `2`
maximum = max(1, 2)

print(maximum)
```
