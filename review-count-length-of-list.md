# How to count the length of a list in Python
The length of a list is the number of elements that it contains.

## Use [`len()`](kite-sym:builtins.len) to get the length of a list {#use-len}
Call [`len(obj)`](kite-sym:builtins.len) using a list as `obj`.

```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]

# get length of a_list
length = len(a_list)

print(length)
```
