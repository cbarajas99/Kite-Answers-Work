# How to get the first element of a list in Python
Getting the first element of a list returns the element at index `0` in the list. For example, the first element of `[1, 2, 3]` is `1`.

## Use indexing to get the first element of a list {#use-indexing}
Use the indexing syntax `list[index]` with `index` as `0` to get the first element of `list`.
```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
# get first item of list
first_element = a_list[0]

print(first_element)
```
