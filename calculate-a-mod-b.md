# How to calculate a mod b in Python
`a` mod `b` results in the remainder of division of `a` by `b`. For example, `11` mod `3` is `2`.

## Use the `%` operator to calculate a mod b {#use-modulus-operator}
Put `a` on the left side of the `%` operator and `b` on the right side.

```python
a = 11
b = 3

a_mod_b = a % b

print(a_mod_b)
```
