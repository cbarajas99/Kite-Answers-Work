# How to check if a value is greater than another value in Python
Checking if a value is greater than another value returns `True` if the former is greater than the latter and `False` if otherwise. For example, `2 > 1` returns `True`.

## Use the `>` operator to check if a value is greater than another value {#use-greater-than}
Insert the greater-than operator `>` in between two values to create a boolean expression that returns `True` if the left value is greater than the right value and `False` if otherwise.

```python
# Check if `2` is greater than `1`
is_greater_than = 2 > 1

print(is_greater_than)
```
```python
# Check if `1` is greater than `2`
is_greater_than = 1 > 2

print(is_greater_than)
```
```python
# Check if `1` is greater than `1`
is_greater_than = 1 > 1

print(is_greater_than)
```
